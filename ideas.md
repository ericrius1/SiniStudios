solar punk

each world you can fly into

ultra simple - no zoom in/out for web
just mouse over does cool stuff

have oen card be a little ai guy that reads poems

every time its a different poem or come from server

have cool shit flowing from top all the way down

have a little animal hopping along the whole tihng

the canvas extends beyond as well

have one of the songs be alan watts "How to listen to this album"

fade between songs on scroll

each one can be a different layer
and you can activate them all and

then they form a grid

have one card be camera and cool mediapipe
